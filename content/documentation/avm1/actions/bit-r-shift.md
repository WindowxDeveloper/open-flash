### ActionBitRShift

ActionBitRShift pops the shift count from the stack. Pops the value from the stack. The value argument is
converted to a 32-bit signed integer and only the least significant 5 bits are used as the shift count.

The bits in the arg value are shifted to the right by the shift count. ActionBitRShift pushes an S32 number to the
stack.
