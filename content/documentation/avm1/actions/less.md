### ActionLess

ActionLess tests if a number is less than another number

| Field           | Type               | Comment           |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| ActionLess      | ACTIONRECORDHEADER | ActionCode = 0x0F |

ActionLess does the following:
1. Pops value A off the stack.
2. Pops value B off the stack.
3. Converts A and B to floating-point; non-numeric values evaluate to 0.
4. If B < A, true is pushed to the stack for SWF 5 and later (1 is pushed for SWF 4);
   otherwise, false is pushed to the stack for SWF 5 and later (0 is pushed for SWF 4).
