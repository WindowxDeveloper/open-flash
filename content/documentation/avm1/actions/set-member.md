## Adobe documentation

### ActionSetMember

ActionSetMember sets a property of an object. If the property does not already exist, it is created. Any existing
value in the property is overwritten.

| Field             | Type               | Comment           |
|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| ActionSetMember   | ACTIONRECORDHEADER | ActionCode = 0x45 |

ActionSetMember does the following:
1. Pops the new value off the stack.
2. Pops the object name off the stack.
3. Pops the object off of the stack.
